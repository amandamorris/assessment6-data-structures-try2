"""
1. When calculating the Big O notation for a particular algorithm, it’s
necessary to consider the length of time it takes for the algorithm to run as
the algorithm’s workload approaches infinity. You can think of the workload as
the number of tasks required to complete a job. What determines the workload of
figuring out whether your box of animal crackers contains an elephant?

How many crackers are in the box.  We think about worst case scenario, in this
case it's if the last cracker we check is an elephant, so we have to check every
single cracker.  So the number of total crackers determines the workload.

2. Order the following runtimes in descending order of efficiency (that is,
fastest runtimes first, slowest last) as n approaches infinity:
O(1)
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
O(n ** 2)
O(2 ** n)
