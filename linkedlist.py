"""Discsusion Questions
Given the linked list below, which are the nodes? 
The boxes are the nodes - the box containing ("Apple" | next), the box
containing ("Berry" | next), the box containing ("Cherry" | next).

What is the data for each node?
The data for each node is the text string: "Apple", "Berry", "Cherry".
Where is the head?
The head is the node with data "Apple".
Where is the tail?
The tail is the node with data "Cherry".

What's the difference between doubly- and singly-linked lists?
In a singly linked list, each node has an attribute to track the 'next' node in
the list, but no attribute to track the "prev" node in the list.  In a doubly
linked list, each node has an attribute for both "next" and "prev", so that
we can traverse a doubly linked list in either direction.
Why is it faster to append to a linked list if we keep track of the tail as an
attribute?
Without tail as an attribute of the list, in order to find the end of the list,
we have to traverse the entire list until we find a node whose "next" is None.
This is an O(n) operation.  If we keep track of the tail of a linked list, then
finding the end of the list is O(1), because we don't need to traverse the list,
we can just check the tail.
