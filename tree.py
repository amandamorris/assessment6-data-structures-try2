"""Discussion Questions
Given the tree above, in what order would a Breadth First Search (BFS)
algorithm visit each node until finding burritos (starting at food)? Just list
the order of nodes visited; no need to recreate the state of the algorithm data
in your answer.

Given the tree above, in what order would a Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm
visit each node until finding Chicago-style (starting at food)? Just list the
order of nodes visited; no need to recreate the state of the algorithm data in
your answer.

How is a binary search tree different from other trees?
A binary search tree is a tree where each node has exactly two children (though
one or both children may be None), and the node data is arranged so that for any
node X, all nodes to the left of X have data less than X's data, and all nodes
to the right of X have data greater than X's data.  That means that if we are
searching for a node Y, we start at the top, and compare Y.data to our current
node's data, and depending on the result we either go left or right.  At each
level we eliminate half of the data, so searching is much faster.
